<h3> Phase1. Design generation </h3>
The design generation phase have three interrelated stages.
<br> </br> 

**Stage 1. Generative model-based design automation**
- Train the IM-GAN (composed by IM-AE and Latent-GAN) to automatically generate the 3D designs.

**Stage 2. Defective design filtering**
- Filter the defective design in generated design dataset.

**Stage 3. Selective data augmentation and model update**
- Randomly select the designs in design dataset from Stage 2, and augment the original design dataset.

<h3> Phase2. Design decision making </h3>
The design decision making phase composed of two stages.

**Stage 4. Performance prediction**
- Train the 3D-CNN models to predict the performance criteria of generated designs.

**Stage 5. Design evaluation and selection**
- Select the designs by predicted performance criteria using TOPSIS method.

<h3> Automation </h3>

This section describes the automation process from Stage 1 to Stage 5, aiming to visualize the 3D plot of the Pareto optimal set.
- Stages 2, 4, and 5 are integrated into an automated pipeline to visualize the Pareto optimal set derived from the generated designs after defective design filtering.
